/*
A shopfront
The project will start as a database whereby:
- as an administrator, you can add products, which consist of an id, a price and a stock.
- as a regular user you can buy 1 of the products.
- as the owner you can make payments or withdraw value from the contract.

Eventually, you will refactor it to include:
- ability to remove products.
- co-purchase by different people.
- add merchants akin to what Amazon has become.
- add the ability to pay with a third-party token.
